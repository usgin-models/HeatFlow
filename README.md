HeatFlow
========
This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for heat 
flow data. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the 
content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook indicates the content requested for observation features 
representing Heat Flow measurements. The content model is based on specifications 
gathered from the SMU Heat Flow database, and has been extended to include the 
specifics of Heat Flow data from other parties.

Services have been deployed using the 1.15 schema as well as the newer 1.23 
version. Those with the latest version are indicated as such in the service name.
